# Tiptap Annotation Magic
## Description

This is an extension for the [Tiptap](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap) editor (based on ProseMirror). It's unique
for its ability to **render overlapping annotations** as fragments. Annotations are rendered as [Decorations](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.Decorations)
and are therefore not a part of the Prosemirror Document.

## Installation

``npm install --save tiptap-annotation-magic``

## Demo

See a Demo using React on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-4gxggz?file=src%2FTiptap.tsx)
